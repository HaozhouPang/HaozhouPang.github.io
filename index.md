<!-- ## About Me -->

<img style='float: right;' width='225' height='225' src='img.jpg'>

Hey! This is Haozhou's (昊洲) page. I now work at Bytedance as a machine learning engineer in Shenzhen, China. My areas of interest span over Computer Vision, LLM, Computer Graphics, Theoretical CS, and competitive programming.


Before joining Bytedance, I did my undergrad and M.Sc in Alberta, Canada, both in Computing Science. During my Master program, I was fortunate enough to work with [Dr. Mohammad Salavatipour](http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~mreza/). 

Best way to contact me: haozhoupang PUT THE SIGN HERE gmail DOT com.
