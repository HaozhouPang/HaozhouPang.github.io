<!-- ## About Me -->

<img style='float: right;' width='225' height='225' src='img.jpg'>
Hey! This is Haozhou's (昊洲) page. I now work at Bytedance as a machine learning engineer in Shenzhen, China. My areas of interest span over Computer Vision, Computer Graphics, Theoretical CS, and competitive programming.

My work mainly focus on using Computer Visoin and Computer Graphics knowledge to help artists to create better games more efficiently. Projects that I have been working on include 3D game character auto-generation; facial expression & gesture generation driven by audio; controllable motion generation for both biped and quadruped characters. In short, my work makes a digital character talk, walk and perform just like a real human. 

Before joining Bytedance, I did my undergrad and M.Sc in Alberta, Canada, both in Computing Science. During my Master program, I was fortunate enough to work with [Dr. Mohammad Salavatipour](http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~mreza/).
