<!-- ## About Me -->

<img style='float: right;' width='225' height='225' src='circle.png'>

I am Fushan Li. I now work at Amazon as a machine learning engineer in Vancouver, Canada. I am excited about applying reinforcement learning, deep learning and AI research to real-world applications.

Before that, I earned my MSc degree in Computer Science at the University of Alberta. 
During my Masters, I was fortunate enough to work with my advisors, [Prof. Michael Bowling](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~bowling/index.html) and [Prof. Dale Schuurmans](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~dale/). 
I had a [paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/9714-ease-of-teaching-and-language-structure-from-emergent-communication) published at NeurIPS on multi-agent reinforcement learning.

You can reach me at fushanseu AT gmail dot com.
