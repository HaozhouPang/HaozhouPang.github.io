<!-- ## About Me -->

<img style='float: right;' width='225' height='225' src='img.jpg'>

Hey! This is Haozhou's (昊洲) page. I now work at Bytedance as a machine learning engineer in Shenzhen, China. My areas of interest span over Computer Vision, LLM, Computer Graphics, Theoretical CS, and competitive programming.


Before joining Bytedance, I did my undergrad and M.Sc in Alberta, Canada, both in Computing Science. During my Master program, I was fortunate enough to work with [Dr. Mohammad Salavatipour](http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~mreza/).

## Fun Projects 

- Motion Capture from Video - "JiNiTaiMei". Extracting joints rotation and root translation from videos then retargeting to a customized character. Algorithm runs in real-time.

- Audio-driven dance generation. We develep an global position aware large model to generate realistic and diverse group dances while maintaining strong music correlation and dancer-wise consistency.

- Emotional Talking Face generation. We build a model to generate realistic 3D talking face conditioned on audio. The model supports multiple languages and 8 different emotions. (happy, sad, etc.) The model runs in real-time with RTF 0.1.
